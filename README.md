### Welcome aboard ! ###
Orizon is an informative website for kids and teenagers aged between 10 and 17 years old, about the upcoming space race. Starting with the Moon, you can browse through all the missions already scheduled. 

Spoutnik, our cat mascot, will be your fellow traveler for this space journey. He will guide you through the website, from missions to quizzes, stopping by the news section and your profile.

This is a school project and a team effort. An online version will soon be avalaible when we have fixed a few things (a better responsive design, stronger authentication features, possibility to add your own quiz, unit tests, etc). In the mean time, the project is fully functional. You can either watch the demonstration [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRnSeJcDcPs&feature=youtu.be&t=5041) and/or you can access the website by: 


- Cloning the repository
- Creating a local database with your favorite database management system (we used PostgreSQL) thanks to the two files
  ` api/import_table.sql` and `api/import_data.sql`
- Creating a .env file following the `api/.env.example` 
- Running yarn install both in the api and the client folders to install dependencies
- Running `node index.js` in the `api` folder
- Running `yarn start` in the client folder

```/!\ You will need a Node.js working environment and a database management system /!\```
